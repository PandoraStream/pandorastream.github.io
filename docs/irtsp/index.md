# iRTSP Protocol

The iRTSP Protocol (presumably standing for Interactive Real Time Streaming Protocol) is a streaming protocol based on the standard [RTSP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2326.txt) protocol used by Ubitus on the GameNow and GameCloud services.

It has some additions to allow the client to interact with the server, this way allowing games to send user input to the server, so that the server can process it and send the gameplay back in various streams.
